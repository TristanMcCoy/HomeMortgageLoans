Title: "Addressing Equity in Home Mortgage Loans: An Excel-Based AB Testing Project to Investigate Racial Discrimination"

Summary:

This project focuses on utilizing AB testing, implemented in Excel, to investigate potential evidence of racial discrimination in home mortgage loan applications. The primary objective is to analyze disparities in approval rates between different racial groups, shedding light on potential biases in lending practices. This project not only leverages Excel's analytical capabilities but also holds significant implications for addressing equity concerns in the financial industry.

This Excel-based AB testing project provides a systematic and data-driven approach to assess potential racial discrimination in home mortgage loan approvals. By uncovering and addressing disparities, financial institutions can not only fulfill their legal and ethical obligations but also enhance trust, reputation, and market opportunities. This project serves as a valuable tool in promoting fairness, transparency, and inclusivity in the financial sector, contributing to a more equitable and responsible business environment.


Key Features:

AB Testing Methodology: The project employs AB testing, a statistical method commonly used in experimental design, to compare the approval rates of mortgage loan applications between two groups: one representing a specific racial demographic and the other serving as a control group.

Excel Analysis: Leveraging the power of Excel, the project facilitates the organization, analysis, and visualization of large datasets, allowing for a comprehensive examination of approval patterns and disparities.

Statistical Significance: By applying statistical tests within Excel, the project aims to determine whether observed differences in approval rates are statistically significant, providing evidence to support or refute the presence of racial discrimination in mortgage lending.


Business Implications:

Compliance and Risk Mitigation: Identifying and addressing potential racial biases in mortgage loan approval processes is critical for financial institutions to ensure compliance with anti-discrimination laws and mitigate legal and reputational risks.

Customer Trust and Reputation: Demonstrating a commitment to fair lending practices enhances customer trust and reputation, positioning financial institutions as socially responsible entities and attracting a diverse customer base.

Business Strategy and Market Expansion: Addressing racial disparities in mortgage lending allows businesses to align with societal expectations, potentially unlocking new markets and expanding their customer base.

Regulatory Compliance: As regulatory bodies increasingly emphasize fair lending practices, an Excel-based AB testing approach helps financial institutions proactively assess and rectify potential issues, ensuring ongoing compliance with evolving regulations.

Ethical Business Practices: Conducting AB testing in Excel to examine racial discrimination in mortgage lending reflects an organization's dedication to ethical business practices, fostering a positive corporate culture and promoting inclusivity.
